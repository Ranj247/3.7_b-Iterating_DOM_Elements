        <h1>Using JavaScript to create tables and lists in HTML.</h1>
        <p>The concept of the DOM being a data structure gives way to the realization that it's possible to iterate through almost anything in the DOM, 
            right down to text nodes. One common way this is used is in creating, manipulating or removing large numbers of repetitive DOM elements in a loop. 
            This is really useful when you want to use JavaScript to create tables and lists in HTML.
        </p>
        
        <p>To illustrate the concept of iterating DOM elements, consider that you want to create a table in your HTML. The table might have 1000 rows, 
            so it would be very tedious and time consuming to create all that HTML manually! Instead, you can use JavaScript with a simple loop, and 
            an array of the items you want to put in the table. For illlustration purposes, let's just say it's a table of 1000 random numbers between 1 and 1000, 
            but it could really be anything you wish. Also note that there are more efficient and less verbose ways to do this, but it's shown step by step here 
            to solidify the concept.
        </p>
        
        <p>To understand how this is possible, just think about the things you need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You need to somehow create 1000 random numbers (perhaps Math.random() may be of use here?)
            </li>
            <li>
                You need to create the header row of the table; we'll say it has two columns: Item #, and Value (the actual number)
            </li>
            <li>
                Inside the body of the table, you need to create 1000 rows, each with two columns (the item number and its value from the array). 
                This can be accomplished with a simple for or while loop.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notice there is no <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element in the HTML file ... where could it be coming from?!</p>
